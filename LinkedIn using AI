Linked In using AI is  part of the major course AI and Data Science by the Be10x organisation. 
In this course, we will learn about using LinkedIn in hyper-efficient ways. For starters, the initial goal is to get 10,000 followers for our profile.
In the session, highly useful tools were shared to achieve the goal. One of the other benefits is that with great connections and a follower base, we will be able to acquire the business we aim for and for some land
in their dream job easily.

To make this possible, we have to have the habit of posting every day on LinkedIn. In this course, posting high-quality content is taught along with how to acquire customer engagement.

Some of the commitments required are
> Posting every day on LinkedIn
> Connect with friends every day.
> Give and take endorsements.
> Outreach through customer engagements and positive comments.
