Linked In using AI is  part of the major course AI and Data Science by the Be10x organisation. 
In this course we will learn about using LinkedIn at hyper efficient ways. For starters the initial goal is to get 10,000 followers for our profile.
In the session highly useful tools were shared to achieve the goal. One of the other benefits is that with great connections and follower base, we will be able to acquire the business we aim for and for some land
in their dream job easily.

To make this possible, we have to have the habit of posting everyday on LinkedIn. In this course, posting high quality contents is taught along with how to acquire customer engagement.

Some of the commitments required are
> Posting everyday on LinkedIn
> Connect with friends everyday.
> Give and take endorsements.
> Outreach through customer engaments and positive comments.
